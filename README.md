Hybrid Quantum Transfer Learning with MINST data

# Basic idea:

The basic idea of using a boson sampler layer in the model is to leverage the inherent complexity of the boson sampling process as a form of memory for the parameters in the learning model. Unlike classical neural networks where memory is explicitly encoded in weights and activations, the boson sampler layer captures correlations and interference patterns that implicitly store and process information. This allows the model to retain and utilize complex relationships between input features through quantum interference effects. However, the challenge arises in aligning this quantum memory with the classical feature extraction process, as the quantum encoding may not effectively translate the classical features into a useful quantum representation for classification tasks.
